# Getting started in R

To download R, go to:
  
  https://cloud.r-project.org

and then click on the link for either Mac, Windows or Linux depending on your computer.

To install RStudio, go to:
  
  http://www.rstudio.com/download

RStudio is an integrated development environment (or IDE) for R programming.
It makes writing and running R code more fun.

If all of that is completely mystifying, have a look at this section from R for

If you are 100% brand new to R, getting R and RStudio installed on your
computer can be the hardest and most frustrating part. It's not intuitive and
it has nothing to do with the work you want to do. I have been there and I
have smashed my head in frustration many times. Stick with it and use the
online resources for guidance. Once it's done, it's done.
